Project Overview

Objective: Develop a robust pipeline in Azure DevOps to build Docker images from source code, test and scan images, and push them securely to Azure Container Registry (ACR). This journey will enhance your understanding of CI/CD for containerized applications, automation, and best practices for security and efficiency.

Project Phases & Schedule
Phase 1: Setup and Fundamentals (1 week)

Goal: Get familiar with the project environment and foundational concepts.
Tasks:
Set up Azure DevOps and link it to your Azure account.
Create an ACR instance with appropriate permissions.
Install Docker locally and ensure access to Azure CLI and Docker CLI.
Deliverables:
Documentation of Azure DevOps and ACR setup.
Verification of ACR access using Azure CLI.
Acceptance Criteria: A secure connection between Azure DevOps and ACR, access rights tested and validated.

Phase 2: Docker Image Creation and Testing (1 week)

Goal: Build Docker images locally and define standards for image naming, tagging, and versioning.
Tasks:
Develop a Dockerfile for a sample application (Node.js or Python).
Run and test the Docker container locally.
Push the initial image to ACR manually.
Deliverables:
A functional Dockerfile with application running locally.
Image successfully pushed to ACR with standardized tags.
Acceptance Criteria: Docker image creation, testing, and manual push to ACR verified.

Phase 3: Automating Image Builds with Azure DevOps Pipelines (2 weeks)

Goal: Automate the process of building, testing, and pushing images to ACR using a CI/CD pipeline.
Tasks:
Set up a pipeline in Azure DevOps to automate Docker builds.
Incorporate image scanning and testing stages (using tools like Trivy for vulnerability scanning).
Define pipeline parameters, including triggers, branch protections, and secrets management.
Deliverables:
Complete YAML pipeline file with stages for build, test, scan, and push.
Logs and pipeline history in Azure DevOps.
Acceptance Criteria: Successfully automated pipeline with an image build, scan, and push flow that runs without errors.

Phase 4: Implementing Security Best Practices (1 week)

Goal: Enhance the pipeline by integrating security measures.
Tasks:
Implement ACR authentication with managed identities for security.
Add role-based access control (RBAC) for ACR access.
Incorporate vulnerability scanning as a pipeline stage with a conditional approval process.
Deliverables:
Security documentation covering managed identities, RBAC settings, and scan policies.
Acceptance Criteria: All security measures are documented and operational within the pipeline, with scanning results logged for review.

Phase 5: Monitoring and Optimizing Performance (1 week)

Goal: Set up monitoring and optimize the pipeline for performance and reliability.
Tasks:
Implement Azure Monitor for tracking pipeline and ACR activity.
Configure alerts for failed builds or security issues.
Review logs and optimize pipeline stages to reduce build and deploy time.
Deliverables:
Performance report with recommendations for pipeline optimizations.
Azure Monitor and alerting setup.
Acceptance Criteria: Monitoring, alerting, and performance improvements are documented and verified.
